# pi-project
Lukas' und Dominik's Raspberry Pi Spiel.

In order to be able to play the game, you need to download the pygame package for your corresponding python versions.
The latest versions of pygame for python3 are avalible here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame
This game was built on pygame version 1.9.2 and python version 3.5.2. No updates have been carried out.

The keyboard player plays with WASD and shoots with SPACE, the pi player uses the joystick for all controls. 
The pi player is red, the PC player green. Both players have 3 lives each. The first player to lose all his lives, loses.
Crashing into other players resets the playing field.
